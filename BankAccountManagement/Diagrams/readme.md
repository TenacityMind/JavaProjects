# UML Diagrams for Bank Account Management System

This folder contains the UML diagrams for the Bank Account Management System project. These diagrams illustrate the system's design, showcasing its structure and interactions between different components.

### 1.Use Case Diagram

The Use Case Diagram illustrates the primary interactions between the user and the system. It provides an overview of the system's functionality by defining the roles (actors) and the use cases (functionalities) they can access.

Actors:

User: Represents the customer interacting with the system to manage their bank account.

#### Use Cases:

**Create Account:** Enables the user to create a new bank account.
**Deposit Money:** Allows the user to add funds to their account.
**Withdraw Money:** Allows the user to withdraw money, provided there is sufficient balance.
**View Balance:** Enables the user to check the current balance of their account.

#### Key Insights:

Each use case is independent, and the user can access them directly.
The diagram showcases the modularity of the system and highlights its core functionalities.
